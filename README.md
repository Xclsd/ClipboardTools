- **Process**:
  - Extracts the clipboard content from the Edge Debugger.
  - Parses the URI, HTTP Method, and Body (if applicable).
  - Generates PowerShell commands to perform the exact Graph API request using `Invoke-MgGraphRequest`.
  - Automatically adds the necessary scopes for Microsoft Graph API authentication (`Connect-MgGraph`).
  - Outputs the generated script back to the clipboard, ready for immediate use.
  
**Prerequisites**:  
To execute the generated PowerShell script, ensure that the `Microsoft.Graph.Authentication` module is installed. Here's the command to install it:
```powershell
Install-Module -Name Microsoft.Graph.Authentication -Scope CurrentUser
```

**Usage**:
1. Open Edge and navigate to a web page where you want to extract a Graph API (or any REST API) call.
2. Open the Edge Debugger by pressing **F12** and navigate to the **Network** tab.
3. Perform an action that triggers a network request (such as loading a page or submitting a form).
4. Right-click on the network call you're interested in and select "**Copy -> Copy as PowerShell**".
5. Run the following command to transform the copied script:
```powershell
ClipboardTools-EdgeDebuggerMGGraphPowerShellScript
```
6. Paste the generated script into your editor or console.

**Inputs**:  
Reads the PowerShell script exported from Edge Debugger and stored in the clipboard.

**Outputs**:  
The function generates a PowerShell script ready for execution, based on the Microsoft Graph API call from Edge Debugger. The script is copied to the clipboard.

**Example Code for GET Request**:
```powershell
# Connect to Graph API using Microsoft Graph module

# Install Microsoft.Graph.Authentication module with command
# Install-Module -Name Microsoft.Graph.Authentication -Scope CurrentUser
#Connect-MgGraph

Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All", "DeviceManagementApps.Read.All", "DeviceManagementConfiguration.Read.All", "User.Read.All", "Group.Read.All", "GroupMember.Read.All", "Directory.Read.All"

$Uri = "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/deviceManagement/managedDevices"

# Get data from Graph API
$MgGraphRequest = Invoke-MgGraphRequest -Uri $Uri -Method 'GET' -OutputType PSObject

if($MgGraphRequest) {
    # Print results
    # Usually you want to check values from $MgGraphRequest.value
    Write-Host "Print variable MgGraphRequest values:"
    $MgGraphRequest
} else {
    Write-Host "Did not get any results from Graph API!" -ForegroundColor Yellow
}
```

**Example Code for POST Request**:
```powershell
# Connect to Graph API using Microsoft Graph module

# Install Microsoft.Graph.Authentication module with command
# Install-Module -Name Microsoft.Graph.Authentication -Scope CurrentUser
#Connect-MgGraph

Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All", "DeviceManagementApps.Read.All", "DeviceManagementConfiguration.Read.All", "User.Read.All", "Group.Read.All", "GroupMember.Read.All", "Directory.Read.All"

$Uri = "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/deviceManagement/managedDevices"

$Body = @{
    "@odata.type" = "#microsoft.graph.managedDevice"
    "deviceName" = "TestDevice"
} | ConvertTo-Json

# Note: POST requests may not immediately return data. Workaround:
$OutputFilePath = "$($pwd.path)/MgGraphRequest_$(Get-Random).json"
$MgGraphRequest = Invoke-MgGraphRequest -Uri $Uri -Body $Body.ToString() -Method 'POST' -OutputFilePath $OutputFilePath

# Read and convert JSON data from the temporary text file
$MgGraphRequest = Get-Content $OutputFilePath -Raw | ConvertFrom-Json

# Remove temporary file
Remove-Item -Path $OutputFilePath

if($MgGraphRequest) {
    # Print results
    Write-Host "Print variable MgGraphRequest values:"
    $MgGraphRequest
} else {
    Write-Host "Did not get any results from Graph API!" -ForegroundColor Yellow
}
```
